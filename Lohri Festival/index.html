        revolving of the members around the fire is known as <b class="style1" 
            style="outline: 0;">&#39;Agni Ke Phere&#39;</b>. While moving around they murmur a 
        specific Mantra known as <b class="style1" style="outline: 0;">&#39;Gayatri Mantra&#39;</b>. 
        With each round they sacrifice a mixture of 5 edible elements. As each round is 
        completed they put the mixture in the fire by loudly saying <b class="style1" 
            style="outline: 0;">&#39;Swaha&#39;</b> while sacrificing. This sacrifice is known

        <h1>
           Lohri&nbsp; 
            Origin</h1>
  
  
    <p>
        The origin of <b>Lohri</b> is related to the central character of most Lohri 
        songs that is Dulla Bhatti, a Muslim highway robber who lived in Punjab during 
        the reign of emperor Akbar. Besides robbing the rich, he rescued Hindu girls 
        being forcibly taken to be sold in slave markets of the Middle East. He arranged 
        their marriages to Hindu boys with Hindu rituals and provided them with dowries. 
        Understandably, though a bandit, he became a hero of all Punjabis. So every 
        other Lohri song has words to express gratitude to Dulla Bhatti.<br />
        Some believe that Lohri has derived its name from <b>Loi,</b> the wife of Sant 
        Kabir, for in rural Punjab Lohri is pronounced as Lohi. Others believe that 
        Lohri comes from the word <b>&#39;loh&#39;,</b> a thick iron sheet tawa used for baking 
        chapattis for community feasts. Another legend says that <b>Holika</b> and <b>
        Lohri</b> were sisters. While the former perished in the Holi fire, the latter 
        survived.
        <br />
        Eating of til (sesame seeds) and rorhi (jaggery) is considered to be essential 
        on this day. Perhaps the words til and rorhi merged to become tilorhi, which 
        eventually got shortened to Lohri and hence the festival got this name in this 
        unique fashion.<br />
    </p>

            Significance</h1>
    

    <p>
        <span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-SIZE: 15pt"><i>Significance</i></span><br />
        Lohri marks the culmination of winter, and is celebrated on the 13th day of 
        January in the month of Paush or Magh, a day before <b>Makar Sankranti</b>. For 
        Punjabis, this is more than just a festival; it is also an example of a way of 
        life. Lohri celebrates fertility and the spark of life. People gather round the 
        bonfires, throw sweets, puffed rice and popcorn into the flames, sing popular 
        songs and exchange greetings. An extremely auspicious day, Lohri marks the sun&#39;s 
        entry into the <b>&#39;Makar Rashi&#39;</b> (northern hemisphere). The period, beginning 
        from 14 January lasting till 14 July, is known as Uttarayan. It is also the last 
        day of the month of Maargazhi, the ninth month of the lunar calendar. The 
        Bhagawad Gita deems it an extremely sacred and auspicious time, when Lord 
        Krishna manifests himself most tangibly. The Hindus &#39;nullify&#39; their sins by 
        bathing in the Ganges. And so, across India, people celebrate the month and the 
        prodigious harvest it brings - Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Bihu in Assam, Bhogi in 
        Andhra Pradesh and the <b>Sankranti</b> in Karnataka, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.<br />

           Things to do on Lohri</h1>
  
 
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <b>Lohri</b> is also the one day when the womenfolk and children get attention. 
        The first Lohri of a bride is extremely important. The first Lohri of a newborn 
        baby, whether a girl or a boy, is also equally important.<br />
        In the morning on <b>Lohri</b> day, children go from door to door singing and 
        demanding the Lohri <b>&#39;loot&#39; </b>in the form of money and eatables like til 
        (sesame) seeds, peanuts, jaggery, or sweets like gajak, rewri, etc. The focus of 
        Lohri is on the bonfire. In the evening, with the setting of the sun, huge 
        bonfires are lit in the harvested fields and in the front yards of houses and 
        people gather around the rising flames, circle around (parikrama) the bonfire 
        and throw puffed rice, popcorn and other munchies into the fire, shouting <b>
        &quot;Aadar aye dilather jaye&quot;</b> (May honour come and poverty vanish!), and sing 
        popular folk songs. This is a sort of prayer to Agni, the fire god, to bless the 
        land with abundance and prosperity.
        <br />
        After the parikrama, people meet friends and relatives, exchange greetings and 
        gifts, and distribute prasad (offerings made to god). The prasad comprises five 
        main items: til, gajak, jaggery, peanuts, and popcorn. Winter savouries are 
        served around the bonfire with the traditional dinner of <b>makki-ki-roti</b> 
        and <b>sarson-ka-saag.</b> Bhangra dance by men begins after the offering to the 
        bonfire. Dancing continues till late night with new groups joining in amid the 
        beat of drums. Traditionally, women do not join Bhangra. They hold a separate 
        bonfire in their courtyard orbiting it with the graceful gidda dance.<br />
        <b>Lohri</b> celebrates fertility and the joy of life, and in the event of the 
        birth of a male child or a marriage in the family, it assumes a larger 
        significance wherein the host family arranges for a feast and merry-making with 
        the traditional bhangra dance along with rhythm instruments, like the dhol and 
        the gidda.<br />
        Ceremonies that go with the festival of Lohri usually comprise making a small 
        image of the Lohri goddess with gobar (cattle dung), decorating it, kindling a 
        fire beneath it and chanting its praises. The final ceremony is to light a large 
        bonfire at sunset, toss sesame seeds, gur, sugar-candy and rewaris in it, sit 
        round it, sing, dance till the fire dies out. People take dying embers of the 
        fire to their homes. In Punjabi village homes, fire is kept going round the 
        clock by use of cowdung cakes<br />

        <span lang="EN-IN">Lohri is very famous agricultural festival of Punjab and 
        nearby states like Haryana, Jammu, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh etc. <span>&nbsp;</span>The 
        basic concept behind celebration of this festival is exactly not known and there 
        are innumerable stories depending on region and customs. It’s basically the 
        festival of Punjabis and Dogras. It’s celebrated on last day of Paush. Many 
        people believe that it’s celebrated as eve of winter solstice which begins on 21<sup>st</sup> 
        or 22<sup>nd</sup> December and a day before Lohri is celebrated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">Lohri is also a seasonal festival of Punjab. Punjabis have 
        practice of celebrating seasonal festivals like Teej is dedicated to Monsoon, 
        Basant is dedicated to Spring season and in the same way Lohri is dedicated to 
        the end of winter season. On this day children go to the door to the door 
        singing folk songs and collects Lohri which consists Til, gazak, sugar, jaggery, 
        popcorn, peanuts etc. This Lohri collected by children is distributed in the 
        night at the time of Bonfire.
<o:p></o:p></span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">Bonfire is lit after sunset at village square and songs and 
        dances, prayers are performed. In bonfire we find two kinds of practices in one 
        Lohri goddess is made of gobar and this is burnt in the night with praises of 
        Lohri goddess where as in other practice only cow dung and woods are used but 
        there is no reference of goddess Lohri.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <span lang="EN-IN"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">Bhangra and Gidda are the common dance forms which are 
        performed with beats of Dhols and folk songs are sung. The families with recent 
        marriages or child birth have a very high pitch of excitement for the 
        celebration of Lohri.<span>&nbsp; </span>New Bright clothes are worn and with 
        great enthusiasm, music and dances this day is celebrated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">Mungfali, Til, gazak, phulias are served to the guests and 
        Sarso da saag and makki di roti is the main dinner on the day of Lohri.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">As we said above that Lohri is a harvest festival and Punjab 
        is an agrarian state so we can guess the importance of this festival.<span>&nbsp;
        </span>Basically it’s the festival day for peasants but people living in Urban 
        areas also celebrates this festival with same enthusiasm because it gives them a 
        good chance to interact and celebrate with their friends and families. <o:p></o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">In Bollywood movies also we can watch the Lohri celebration 
        which popularised the festival more. In last few years it was picturised in Yash 
        Chopra’s movie Veer Zara with the song Lo aa gayi Lohri ve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN">Lohri celebration is quite similar to the holi celebrations 
        but the concepts of celebration are completely different. <o:p></o:p></span>
