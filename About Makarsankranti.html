        <b>Makar Sankranti Celebrations</b></h2>

<h3>Stories about MakarSankranti</h3>
<h4>Sun</h4>
<p>On Makar Sankranti Sun-God of Hindus begins its ascendancy and entry into the Northern Hemisphere.<br/>
 Sun for the Hindus means "Pratyaksha-Brahman" - the manifest God <br/>
Sun is the one who transcends time and  rotates the proverbial Wheel of Time. <br/>
Sun not only represents God but also stands for an embodiment of knowledge & wisdom.<br/>
People chant  "Gayatri Mantra" and direct to "Sun Go"d to bless them with intelligence & wisdom. <br/>

<h4>Sun movement</h4>
Makar means Capricorn and Sankranti means Good transition. There are 12 sankranti - one in each month when the sun moves from one zodiac sign to the next. <br/>
Each of these sankranti's every month has its own relative importance but two are considered most important  <br/>
- the Mesh (Aries) Sankranti 
- the Makar (Capricorn) Sankranti. <br/>
Transition of the Sun from Sagittarius to Capricorn, during the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is known as Makar Sankranti.
<h4>End of winter season</h4>
From Makarsankranti day - the days start becoming longer & warmer, and cold winter weather start decreasing.<br/>
<h4>Father and Son</h4>
According to "Puranas" - on Makarsankranti day Sun visits the house of his son "Shani". Shani is swami of Makar Rashi. <br/>
These father & son do not ordinarily get along well, but inspite of any difference between each other Lord Sun makes it a point to meet each other Makasankranti day. <br/>
Father in fact himself comes to his son’s house, for a month. <br/>
 Makarsankranti day symbolized the importance of special relationship of father & son.<br/>
 It is the son who has the responsibility to carry forward his fathers dream and the continuity of the family.
<h4>Lord Vishnu</h4>
On Makarsankranti day Lord Vishnu ended the war with Asuras by finishing them off and burying their heads under the Mandar Parvat. <br/>
Makarsankanti festival denotes the end of cruelty and start of an era of righteous living.
<h4>Bhishma</h4>
In Mahabharata, Makarsankranti is described as holy event. <br/>
 Bhishma Pitamah even after being wounded in the Mahabharata war lingered on till Uttarayan set in, so that he can attain heavenly abode in auspiciuous times. <br/>
It is said that death on this day to brings Moksha or salvation to the deceased.<br/>
It is believed that the person, who dies during the period of Uttarayana, becomes free from transmigration. So this day was seen as a sure-shot Good Luck day to start your journey or endeavors to the higher realms beyond. 

<h4>Maharaj Bhagirath  </h4>
 Maharaj Bhagirath, did great Tapasya to bring Gangaji down on the earth for the redemption of 60,000 sons of Maharaj Sagar, who were burnt to ashes at the Kapil Muni Ashram, near the present day Ganga Sagar. <br/>
It was on this day that Bhagirath finally did tarpan with the Ganges water for his unfortunate ancestors and thereby liberated them from the curse. <br/>
After visiting the Patala for the redemption of the curse of Bhagirath’s ancestors Gangaji finally merged in the Sagar. <br/>
Even today a very big Ganga Sagar Mela is organized every year on this day at the confluence of River Ganges and the Bay of Bengal. 
Millions of people take dip in the holy Ganga water and do tarpan for their ancestors.
 Moral of the story is to see to it that the roots of the tree of ‘our’ life are not only intact but nourished well, thereafter alone the tree blooms & flourishes.
There is another spiritually symbolic aspect of this story. The 60,000 cursed son of Maharaj Sagar represent our thoughts, who become dull & dead-like because of uncultured & blind ambition. <br/>
Redemption of such people is only by the waters of Gangaji, brought down ‘to’ & later ‘from’ the Himalayas with great tapasya. This represents dedicated hard work to get the redeeming Brahma-Vidya, which alone enlightens, enthuses & enlivens the life of anyone
    <p>
        This festival is celebrated differently in different parts of the country.</p>
    <p>
        <a id="Andhra Pradesh" name="Andhra Pradesh"></a>Andhra Pradesh</p>
    <p>
        It is a four day festival in Andhra Pradesh<br />
        Day 1- <b>Bhogi Panduga</b> (Bhogi)<br />
        Day 2 - <b>Pedda Panduga</b>,SANKRANTI (Surya)<br />
        Day 3 - <b>Kanuma Panduga</b> (Kanuma)<br />
        Day 4 - <b>Mukkanuma</b></p>
    <p>
        The first day of festival is <b>Bhogi</b>. At dawn people light up a bonfire 
        with several old articles in their house. In many familities they celebrate <b>
        Bhogi pallu</b>, in the evening. These are the regi pallu with petals of flower 
        and coins of money, will be put on the heads of kids(generally younger than 3 
        years)(like talambralu) to get rid of Dishti(drushti). The second day is <b>
        Sankranti</b>, the big festival, when everyone wears new clothes and pray to 
        their favourite God by offering them sweets. <b>Kanuma Panduga</b> (Kanuma) is 
        less celebrated but is an integral part of Sankranti culture. <b>Mukkanuma</b> 
        is famous among the non-vegetarians of the society. People do not eat any 
        non-vegetarian during the first three days of the festival and eat it only on 
        the day of Mukkanuma.</p>
    <p>
        Sankranti usually represents all the four days together. It is celebrated in 
        almost every village with adventurous games in South India. Whether it is the 
        cock fights in Andhra, Bull fighting in Tamil Nadu or Elephant Mela in Kerala, 
        there is huge amount of illegal betting but the so called tradition continues to 
        play a major role in the festival. Another notable feature of the festival in 
        South India is the Haridas who moves around begging for rice wishing luck to the 
        household. <b>Rangoli</b> competitions too are a common sight. The entire month 
        from mid-December to sankranthi is celebrated with giant rangolis in front of 
        the house which are drawn only at late night for the entire month. For all other 
        days of the year, rangoli is typically drawn in mornings only.</p>
    <p>
        <a id="Orissa" name="Orissa"></a>Orissa
    </p>
    <p>
        It has a special significance in <b>Orissa</b>. It&#39;s a most precious day for 
        Oriya people. Makar Sankranti marks the beginning of the Sun&#39;s journey to the 
        Northern Hemisphere (Makara raasi), signifying the onset of Uttarayana 
        Punyakalam. Makar Sankranti is celebrated with gusto in mid-January when the Sun 
        enters the orbit of capricon. The sun god is worshipped with great fervour and 
        enthusiasm by one and all. The festival can be best enjoyed at <b>Kalijai</b> 
        (an island in Chilika), <b>Atri </b>(Khurda), <b>Ghatgaon, Keonjhar, Jashipur, 
        puri</b> and <b>Jagatsinghpur</b>. A special kind of sweet rice is offered to 
        the local god and goddess. In Jagannath temple at puri this festival is observed 
        as Uttarayana Yatra and Uttarayan Vandapana of lord Jagannath. This special 
        sweet rice (Raw Chawal) is made with sugar, Banana, Cheese, Piled coconut, 
        Camphor and black pepper and offered to the God. This special rice is popularly 
        known as &quot;<b>Makara Chaula</b>&quot;. This day is also observed in Jagannath temple, 
        puri with two popular Veshas (costumes) of Lord Jagannath i.e. Nabanka Vesha 
        (one day before makar sankaranti) and Makara Chaurashi Vesha (on the day of 
        Makar Sankaranti).</p>
    <h4>         Tamil Nadu </h4>

    <p>
        In Tamil Nadu Sankranti is known by the name of &#39;<b>Pongal</b>, which takes its 
        name from the surging of rice boiled in a pot of milk, and this festival has 
        more significance than even Diwali. It is very popular particularly amongst 
        farmers. Rice and pulses cooked together in ghee and milk is offered to the 
        family deity after the ritual worship. In essence in the South this Sankranti is 
        a &#39;<b>Puja</b> (worship) for the Sun God.
    </p>
    <h4>        Maharashtra      </h4>
    <p>
        In <b>Maharashtra</b> on the Sankranti day people exchange multi-colored tilguds 
        made from til (sesame seeds) and sugar and til-laddus made from til and jaggery. 
        Til-polis are offered for lunch. While exchanging tilguls as tokens of goodwill 
        people greet each other saying -- &#39;<b>til-gul ghya, god god bola</b>&#39; meaning 
        &#39;accept these tilguls and speak sweet words&#39;. The under-lying thought in the 
        exchange of tilguls is to forget the past ill-feelings and hostilities and 
        resolve to speak sweetly and remain friends. This is a special day for the women 
        in Maharashtra when married women are invited for a get-together called &#39;<b>Haldi-Kumkum</b> 
        and given gifts of any utensil, which the woman of the house purchases on that 
        day. Hindus wear ornaments made of &#39;<b>Halwa</b>&#39; on this day.</p>
    <h4>         Karnataka     </h4>
    <p>
        In <b>Karnataka</b>, the festival is marked by visiting one&#39;s friends and 
        relatives to exchange greetings, and by the preparation of a dish called <b>Ellu</b> 
        (made with sesame seeds, coconuts, sugar blocks, etc). A common custom found 
        across Karnataka is the exchange of sugarcane pieces and Ellu with one&#39;s 
        neighbors, friends and relatives. In Karnataka, Pongal is known as &#39;<b>Sankranti</b>&#39;, 
        and cows and bullocks are gaily decorated and fed &#39;<b>Pongal</b>&#39;- a sweet 
        preparation of rice. Special prayers are offered. In the evening, the cattle are 
        led out in procession to the beat of drums and music. In the night a bonfire is 
        lit and the animals are made to jump over the fire.<br />
        <b>Makar Sankranti</b> is marked by men, women and children wearing colorful 
        clothing; visiting near and dear ones; and exchanging pieces of sugarcane, a 
        mixture of fried til, molasses, pieces of dry coconut, peanuts and fried gram. 
        On this auspicious day, people in Karnataka distribute Yellu and bella (Sesame 
        seeds and Jaggery) and greet with the words &quot;<b>Ellu bella thindu, Olle Maathu 
        Aadu</b>&quot; (Eat sesame seeds and speak only good). The significance of this 
        exchange is that sweetness should prevail in all the dealings.</p>
    <h4>         Gujarat     </h4>
    <p>
        In <b>Gujarat</b> Sankranti is observed more or less in the same manner as in 
        Maharashtra but with a difference that in Gujarat there is a custom of giving 
        gifts to relatives. The elders in the family give gifts to the younger members 
        of the family. The <b>Gujarati</b> Pundits on this auspicious day grant 
        scholarships to students for higher studies in astrology and philosophy. This 
        festival thus helps the maintenance of social relationships within the family, 
        caste and community. Kite flying has been associated with this festival in a big 
        way. It has become an internationally well-known event.</p>
    <h4>
       Uttar Pradesh     </h4>
    <p>
        In Uttar Pradesh, Sankranti is called &#39;<b>Khichiri</b>&#39;. Taking a dip in the 
        holy rivers on this day is regarded as most auspicious. A big one-month long &#39;<b>Magha-Mela&#39;</b> 
        fair begins at Prayag (Allahabad) on this occasion. Apart from Triveni, ritual 
        bathing also takes place at many places like Haridvar and Garh Mukteshwar in 
        Uttar Pradesh, and Patna in Bihar.</p>
   
   <h4>Kerala</h4>
<p>
The 40 days anushthana by the devotees of Ayyappa ends on Makarsankranti day in Sabarimala </p>
<h4>Madhya Pradesh</h4>
In Madhya Pradesh and in Bundelkhand Makarsankranti is celebrated as‘Sakarat’ .
<h4>Orissa</h4>
<p>Many tribals in Orissa and other part of India start their New Year from the day of Sankrant by lighting bonfires, dancing and eating their particular dishes sitting together. <br/>
 The Bhuya tribals of Orissa have their Maghyatra in which small home-made articles are put for sale.<br/>

    <h2>        Sankranti History</h2>
    <p>
        The festival of Makar Sankranti marks the day when the sun begins its northward 
        journey and enters the sign of <b>Makar</b> (the Capricorn) from the <b>Tropic 
        of Cancer</b>. It is like the movement of sun from <b>Dakshinayana</b> (south) 
        to <b>Uttarayana</b> (north) hemisphere. It is the one of the few chosen Indian 
        Hindu festivals which has a fixed date. This day falls on the 14th of January 
        every year according to the Hindu Solar Calendar.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Sankranti</b> means transmission of Sun from one zodiac in Indian astrology 
        to the other. As per Hindu customary beliefs, there are 12 such Sankrantis in 
        all. But the festival is celebrated only on the occasion of Makara Sankaranti 
        i.e. the transition of the Sun from <b>Sagittarius</b> (&#39;Dhanu&#39; Rashi ) to <b>
        Capricorn</b>(&#39;Makara&#39; Rasi). In this case, the zodiacs are measured sidereally, 
        and not tropically, in order to account the Earth&#39;s precession. That is why the 
        festival falls about 21 days after the tropical winter solstice which lies 
        between December 20 and 23rd. Here the sun marks the starting of Uttarayana, 
        which means northern progress of Sun.</p>
    <p>
        It is believed that the great <b>Bhishma</b> of Mahabharatha who had fallen to 
        the arrows of <b>Arjun</b> and who had a boon to choose the time of his death, 
        waited on the bed of arrows to depart from this world only during this period.</p>

    <h2>        Kites Festival</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        On <b>Sankranti</b>, in cities like Jaipur and Ahmedabad the whole sky is filled 
        with kites - a million or more kites at the same time - all trying to cut each 
        other down! This goes on all day - from before sunrise to after sunset. The 
        whole family participates - lunch, tea and snacks are all served on the terrace; 
        nobody goes indoors until it is too dark to fly anymore. And even then some 
        people leave a kite flying through the night bearing aloft a paper lantern with 
        a candle burning inside.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <b>Makar Sankranti</b> is the great traditional Indian kite festival. It falls 
        on the 14th of January -- the only traditional Indian festival that falls on the 
        same date every year. All other Indian festivals follow the lunar calendar, <b>
        Makar Sankranti</b> is the only one with a solar association -- it marks the 
        transition of the sun into the Northern Hemisphere and is celebrated as a 
        festival of life and fertility. Sweets made of molasses and sesame seeds are 
        traditionally eaten on this day and whole cities come to a halt as everybody is 
        on the rooftops, flying kites.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        An interesting sidelight of <b>Makar Sankranti</b> is the poorer children who 
        roam the streets, looking for kites that have been cut. The simple rule of 
        &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; applies to any kite that&#39;s been cut and these children, too 
        poor to afford buying even a simple paper kite, can still look forward to hours 
        of fun with the kites they collect on <b>Sankranti</b>.</p>
    <p>
        The international Desert Kite Festival is held every January in Jodhpur and 
        Jaipur to coincide with <b>Makar Sankranti</b> and kite flyers from all over the 
        world arrive to fly their own kites and participate in the riotous frenzy of <b>
        Makar Sankranti</b> by flying Indian fighter kites.</p>
    <p>
        In Delhi kites are flown extensively on 26th January and 15th August - Republic 
        Day and Independence Day.</p>
    <p>
        It would be quite accurate to say that while kites are flown all over India as a 
        part of various traditional festivals, <b>Makar Sankranti</b> is the one 
        festival that is totally devoted to kites.</p>
